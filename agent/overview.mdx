## What is an AI Agent?

An AI Agent is an autonomous or semi-autonomous program that can interact with users and systems to perform specific tasks. These agents use artificial intelligence to understand, process, and respond to user inputs while executing predefined actions or making decisions based on their programming and available data.

## Voice AI Agents

Voice AI Agents represent the cutting edge of conversational AI technology, enabling natural spoken interactions between humans and machines. TruFlow's Voice AI Agents currently support two primary communication channels, making them versatile for various business needs.

The first channel operates over traditional telephone lines using Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), seamlessly integrating with Communications Platform as a Service (CPaaS) providers like Twilio. This integration enables businesses to deploy AI agents that can handle incoming and outgoing calls, making them perfect for customer service, appointment scheduling, and automated phone support systems.

The second channel utilizes WebRTC technology, allowing voice interactions directly through web browsers. This browser-based implementation provides a low-latency, high-quality voice experience without requiring users to install additional software. The WebRTC integration supports real-time voice communication, making it ideal for web-based customer support, virtual consultations, and interactive web applications.

When creating a Voice AI Agent, you have two primary approaches available. The template-based method offers a streamlined setup process, leveraging pre-built configurations that can be customized to suit your specific needs. These templates encapsulate best practices and common use cases, making them ideal for quick deployment.

Alternatively, you can create a Voice AI Agent from scratch, giving you complete control over every aspect of its functionality. This approach allows for detailed customization of voice characteristics, conversation flows, and integration capabilities. Whether you choose templates or custom development, you'll need to configure the agent's profile, business context, and specific roles.


## Text AI Agents (COMING SOON)

Text AI Agents serve as the backbone of digital communication, providing sophisticated text-based interactions across various platforms and channels. The creation process focuses on developing agents that can understand and respond to written communication with high accuracy and contextual awareness. Text agents can be configured to handle multiple conversation styles, from formal business communication to casual customer support interactions.

The development process emphasizes natural language processing capabilities and integration with existing text-based platforms. These agents can be fine-tuned to maintain consistent brand voice and handle complex queries through sophisticated decision trees and context management.
