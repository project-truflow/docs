1. **Get Slots**: Fetches real-time availability from connected calendars, ensuring up-to-date scheduling options for customers or internal operations.  
2. **Book Slots**: Confirms appointments directly into the selected calendar, reserving time and automatically notifying participants.  

This integration allows users to create highly customizable calendar actions, which can be tagged in the **Prompt** section to enable AI Agents to trigger specific calendar actions for particular tasks. This ensures a seamless, automated experience where calendars are dynamically utilized based on the task requirements.

With support for multiple calendar connections, you can:  
- Assign specific tasks to designated calendars (e.g., sales calls on one calendar, client meetings on another).  
- Allow AI Agents to intelligently use the appropriate calendar for the defined task.  
- Manage diverse workflows efficiently, particularly for SMBs that require scalable and automated scheduling solutions.  

By leveraging this integration, businesses can optimize time management, reduce scheduling conflicts, and ensure a professional experience for both customers and internal teams.
