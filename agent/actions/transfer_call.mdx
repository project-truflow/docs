title: Transfer Call
---

## Overview

This guide explains how to set up call transfer functionality in the AI Agent system, enabling both cold and warm transfers to human agents or other numbers.

## Types of Call Transfers

### Cold Transfer (Blind Transfer)
- Immediately redirects the caller without introduction
- Suitable for simple redirections and high-volume environments
- No context sharing with receiving agent

### Warm Transfer (Announced Transfer)
- Includes briefing the receiving agent before connecting
- Better for complex issues and VIP customers
- Preserves conversation context


<Info>All call recordings and transcription will end once the call is transferred.</Info>
