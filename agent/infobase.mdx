### Why Use Infobase?

In a busy workflow environment, quickly finding the right information can significantly reduce back-and-forth communication and repetitive manual searches. Infobase provides:

- **Unified Source of Truth:** Consolidate all your essential documents in one place.
- **Streamlined Collaboration:** Give your team a single location to reference, update, and discover critical information.
- **Scalable Organization:** Easily navigate and maintain large volumes of content through intuitive structuring and search.


### How it works
You can create knowledge bases, and link them to your agents. When a knowledge base is linked to an agent, the agent will always try to retrieve information from the knowledge base before responding. There’s no need to change your prompt for it to trigger, as it will be done automatically, for every response generation.

During the creation of knowledge bases, it will chunk the source, embed them and store into a vector database.

During the call, when the agent is about to respond, it will use the transcript so far (prompt is not included) to find the most relevant chunks from the knowledge base, and feed them to the LLM as context.
