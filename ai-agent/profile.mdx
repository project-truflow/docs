2. **Select the Timezone**
    - Choose the relevant timezone for your AI agent. This is important for accurate logging of all interactions, especially if your business operates across different regions.
3. **Choose the Language**
    - From the drop-down list, select the language you want your AI agent to use. Options may include English, Spanish, French, and more.
4. **Pick the AI Voice**
    - Select the voice for your AI agent from the given options. You can preview each voice to find the one that best suits your needs.
