Inboxes serve as the central location for viewing and managing all your conversations related activities. Whenever you add a new phone number or integrate a widget, a dedicated inbox is automatically created. Each inbox displays all the call logs associated with that specific phone number or widget, ensuring that your call information is organized and easily accessible.

## Conversation View

In Conversation View, you see your call logs presented in a chat-like format. Rather than displaying each call as an isolated entry, the system groups conversations by contact. This means if you select a particular contact from the list on the left, you will see all past conversations (calls) with that contact in a single, scrollable screen. As you scroll up, older conversation entries load, providing a comprehensive historical view.

### What You Can Do in Conversation View

- **See All Interactions at a Glance:**  
  Instead of sorting through individual call entries, get a complete conversation history for a contact in one place.

- **View Call Details:**  
  For each call in the conversation, you can:
  - Check a brief summary
  - Listen to the call recording
  - View and add tags to categorize the call
  - Click the **"i"** (information) button to see more in-depth details about the call

This format is especially helpful when you need context. For instance, if you're following up on a support inquiry or need to understand the history of a customer's past conversations, Conversation View provides that narrative overview.

## Table View

If you prefer a more traditional list format, switch to Table View. In this mode, every call is displayed as an individual entry in a tabular layout. This view is ideal for users who want a quick overview of all calls without the context of a conversation thread.

### Features of Table View

- **Granular Control:**  
  Each call is listed separately, making it easy to sort, filter, and locate specific call entries by their properties.
  
- **Detailed Inspection:**  
  Clicking on any call entry provides you with the full set of details for that particular interaction, similar to the Conversation View, but focused on that single event.

## Switching Between Views

You can switch between Conversation View and Table View with just a click:
