The **Widget** feature allows you to deploy an AI Agent onto your website. This widget can be customized to match your brand’s look and feel, and it provides an easy interface for users to engage with your AI Agent. Once configured, you simply copy the generated code snippet and insert it into your site’s HTML.

### Brand Settings

- **Brand Name:** A short name or tagline that will be displayed alongside the widget.
- **Brand Logo:** A URL or image reference to display your logo. Ensure the image is a suitable size and format (e.g., PNG or SVG).

### Appearance

- **Subtitle (e.g., "Talk to Customer Support"):**  
  Add a short descriptive text below or near the brand name to give context for the user.
- **Button Color:**  
  Select a color for the button background to match your brand’s palette.
- **Text Color Scheme (Light/Dark):**  
  Choose a text color scheme that contrasts well with the button color and blends with your website’s theme.

### Positioning

- **Position (Bottom Right/Bottom Left):**  
  Determine where on the screen the widget will appear. Common choices are the bottom-right or bottom-left corner of the viewport.

### Call Bubble Text

- **Call Bubble Text:**  
  Customize the text displayed on the initial call-to-action bubble. This is usually a short phrase or question that invites user engagement.

## Embedding the Widget

Once you have configured all settings to your preference:

1. Click on the **"Copy Code"** button in the configuration panel.
2. Insert the copied script tag just before the closing `</body>` tag of your website’s HTML.
