title: Phone Numbers
---


This module allows you to assign dedicated phone numbers to your AI agents. Each number you assign will create a distinct inbox within your dashboard, enabling more targeted call management and routing. By using labels and icons, you can differentiate and organize these numbers and their associated call logs according to your business needs.

## Key Features

- **Dedicated Inboxes:**  
  Every new phone number you add becomes its own inbox, making it simple to focus on specific lines of communication. For example, a “Customer Support” number can have its own inbox separated from a “Sales” number.

- **Custom Inbox Name and Icons:**  
  Assign a name (e.g., "Customer Support," "Sales," "Billing") to each phone number.  
  Add distinctive icons to quickly identify each number’s purpose at a glance.

- **Number-Specific Labels:**  
  Within each number’s settings, you can create and maintain a unique set of labels that apply only to that number. Any calls routed through that number can be quickly categorized and filtered using these labels, allowing for granular organization.  
  *For example, a “Customer Support” number might have labels like “VIP Client,” “Refund Request,” or “Tech Issue.” Calls associated with this number will have access to these labels without cluttering the label space of other numbers.*

### Deleting a Phone Number

You can remove a phone number from your dashboard if it’s no longer needed. Before deleting, consider that:

- Once deleted, the phone number cannot be recovered.
- All call logs associated with that number will be removed from the active inbox.
- Deleted call logs remain accessible under **Archived Call Logs**, ensuring you can still review historical data if needed.

<Warning>
**Important:** Deleting a phone number is a permanent action. Make sure you’ve backed up or reviewed all essential call information before proceeding.
</Warning>

To delete a number:

1. Go to the **Phone Numbers** section.
2. Select the number you want to remove.
3. Click **Delete**, then confirm your decision.
