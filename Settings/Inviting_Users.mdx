### User Access Levels for Inviting New Members

With **Flexible Access Levels**, you can control how much authority each team member has within the platform:

- **Owner**: As the Owner, you have full access, including the ability to invite new users. This role allows you to manage the entire account, including business configurations, billing, and settings. Owners hold the highest level of control, ensuring only key stakeholders can make significant changes or invite additional users. ðŸ”’
- **User**: Users, on the other hand, have access to all features necessary for day-to-day tasks, but they **cannot invite new members**, manage billing, or change account settings. This ensures users can focus on operational tasks without affecting crucial configurations. ðŸ‘¥
