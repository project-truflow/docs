### Accessing Call Filters

1. **Navigate to the Calls Section**
    - On the left sidebar, click on **Calls**.
2. **Open the Call Filters**
    - At the top of the Calls section, next to "Calls", you’ll notice an icon with three lines (the filter icon). Click on it to access the filter options.

### Setting Up Call Filters

1. **Select a Property**
    - After opening the filter menu, click on **Select Property**. A drop-down menu will appear, showing a list of properties you can filter by.
    - Choose the property you’d like to filter, such as **Call Duration**, **Call Sentiment**, **Call Status**, or others.
2. **Select a Value**
    - Once you’ve selected the property, click on **Select Value**. The available values will vary depending on the property you chose. For instance:
        - For **Call Sentiment**, you might see values like **Positive, Negative,** or **Neutral**.
        - For **Call Duration**, you could set a range like **> 5 minutes**.
    - Select the appropriate value for your filter.

### Adding Multiple Filters

1. **Add Another Filter (Optional)**
    - If you want to apply more than one filter, click on **Add Filter**. This allows you to layer multiple filters and narrow down your search even further.
    - Repeat the process of selecting a property and value for each additional filter you wish to apply.
