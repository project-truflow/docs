title: 'Add Contacts'
---
The **Contacts** module acts like a **Mini CRM** where you can store and manage your entire customer/contact database. A **contact** represents a phone number:
- **Incoming call**: A number from which an incoming call is received by the AI agent.
- **Outgoing call**: A number to which the AI agent makes an outgoing call.

Contacts store key information like:
- **Name**
- **Email ID**
- **Phone Number**
- **Custom properties**: Text, Numbers, Address, Date, or URLs.

These details help the AI agent identify **who it is talking to** during live calls and automatically reference this data wherever required.

<Info>If a new contact calls the AI for the first time, a contact is created automatically.</Info>
